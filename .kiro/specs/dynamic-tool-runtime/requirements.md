# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Dynamic Tool Runtime system that integrates with AWS AgentCore to enable agentic agents to dynamically define, validate, and execute custom tools at runtime within a secure sandbox environment. The system enables agents to extend their capabilities by generating and registering new tools while maintaining strict security, observability, and AWS-native design principles.

## Glossary

- **Dynamic_Tool_Runtime**: The core system that manages the lifecycle of dynamically created tools
- **AgentCore_Gateway**: AWS AgentCore's central gateway service for tool registration and invocation
- **Sandbox_Environment**: Isolated execution environment for running generated code safely
- **Tool_Registry**: Component that manages validated tool definitions and metadata
- **Code_Validator**: Component that validates generated code before execution
- **Execution_Monitor**: Component that observes and logs tool execution for security and debugging

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an agentic agent, I want to dynamically define new tools at runtime, so that I can extend my capabilities based on current context and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent submits a tool definition request, THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL validate the tool specification format
2. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL support tool definitions including function signature, parameters, and implementation code
3. WHEN a tool definition is valid, THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL assign a unique tool identifier
4. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL store tool metadata including creation timestamp, agent identifier, and version
5. IF a tool definition contains invalid syntax or structure, THEN THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL return detailed validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all dynamically generated code to execute in a secure sandbox, so that the system remains protected from malicious or faulty code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Sandbox_Environment SHALL isolate tool execution from the host system
2. THE Sandbox_Environment SHALL enforce resource limits including CPU time, memory usage, and network access
3. WHEN code execution exceeds defined limits, THE Sandbox_Environment SHALL terminate the process
4. THE Sandbox_Environment SHALL prevent file system access outside designated temporary directories
5. THE Sandbox_Environment SHALL log all execution attempts and resource usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an agentic agent, I want validated tools to be registered with AgentCore Gateway, so that I can invoke them through the standard AgentCore interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool passes validation, THE Tool_Registry SHALL register the tool with the AgentCore_Gateway
2. THE Tool_Registry SHALL provide tool discovery capabilities through the AgentCore_Gateway API
3. THE AgentCore_Gateway SHALL route tool invocation requests to the appropriate Dynamic_Tool_Runtime instance
4. THE Tool_Registry SHALL maintain tool versioning and support tool updates
5. WHEN a tool is deregistered, THE Tool_Registry SHALL remove it from the AgentCore_Gateway

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive code validation before execution, so that only safe and compliant code runs in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code_Validator SHALL perform static analysis on all submitted code
2. THE Code_Validator SHALL check for prohibited operations including system calls, network access, and file operations
3. THE Code_Validator SHALL validate code against security policies and compliance rules
4. IF code contains security violations, THEN THE Code_Validator SHALL reject the tool definition
5. THE Code_Validator SHALL maintain an audit log of all validation decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want full observability into tool creation and execution, so that I can monitor system health and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Execution_Monitor SHALL log all tool creation, validation, and execution events
2. THE Execution_Monitor SHALL integrate with AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logging
3. THE Execution_Monitor SHALL track performance metrics including execution time and resource usage
4. THE Execution_Monitor SHALL provide real-time alerts for security violations or system errors
5. THE Execution_Monitor SHALL maintain execution history for audit and debugging purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to follow AWS-native design patterns, so that it integrates seamlessly with existing AWS infrastructure and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL use AWS Lambda for serverless tool execution
2. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL store tool definitions in Amazon DynamoDB
3. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL use Amazon S3 for code artifact storage
4. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL implement AWS IAM for access control and permissions
5. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL use AWS API Gateway for external API endpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system designer, I want a modular architecture, so that components can be independently developed, tested, and scaled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL implement clear interfaces between all major components
2. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL support independent deployment of validation, execution, and registry components
3. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL use event-driven communication between components
4. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL support horizontal scaling of execution environments
5. THE Dynamic_Tool_Runtime SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns for component failure handling
